## Building Your Own Personal List

```
To be completed by September 12th
```

A 'syllabus' is supposed to mean a summary or outline of the main propositions of a course, the main points of discourse. Too often, it is being treated as if it were the 'terms-of-service' or, even worse, a legal contract of some kind.

Learning is too messy for that crap.

So, now that you've had a chance to explore the [choose-your-own-adventure syllabus](/docs/syllabus/cyoa), I want you to post in the `#syllabus` channel about it. What surprises you about the content? What makes you nervous? What's missing? Which readings do you *really* want to explore? I want you to horse-trade, too, so that everyone has a unique list of four main readings, because in the next few weeks we're going to do a deep dive on all the readings, 4 x however many of you are in the course.
